# Trader Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes trader performance and behavior under different
market sentiment conditions such as Fear, Greed, and Extreme Greed.

## Project Structure
- Part A: Data preparation and metric creation
- Part B: Performance, behavioral analysis, and trader segmentation
- Part C: Strategy recommendations based on findings

## Key Insights
- Traders show stronger profitability during Fear periods.
- Greed periods are associated with higher trading activity and larger
  position sizes, but not consistently better performance.
- Higher trading frequency does not guarantee better outcomes.
